WHY BABYNAME?

This is a JavaScript tool that takes US Census data for baby names for an arbitrary year, stuffs them into a Markov chain-like tree, and then uses that tree to generate NEW baby names that are (hopefully) phonetically possible. 

Name your own baby (or yourself!) using this tool at your own risk :)
